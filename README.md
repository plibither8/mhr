# mhr

> ðŸ”— A simple URL shortener, controlled via a Telegram bot.

mhr = mihir, but shortened (\*_\*).

## Setup

### Create a Telegram Bot

You would first need to create a Telegram bot and get the bot's access token. Fortunately, it's pretty simple and easy: you can create one with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

Make sure to take note of the token received! It should look like this: `3141592653:KAS_JFD04YEGFxbQV4FTPetQpZefUhr37HC`.

### Get your Telegram Chat ID

The `chat_id` identifies you on Telegram. You can get it by `/start`ing a chat with [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) or [some other ways](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423837/telegram-bot-how-to-get-a-group-chat-id). It can be a positive or negative number.

### Setup the Server

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/plibither8/mhr`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create `config.ts` file from [`config.example.ts`](config.example.ts) file: `cp config.example.ts config.ts`
4. Edit the `config.ts` file with **your values**
5. Start up the server and use the bot: `npm start`
6. Party hard.

## Usage

Open the chat with your bot and `/start` it.

Interact with your Telegram bot to create, read, update or delete the aliases. Following are the available commands:
